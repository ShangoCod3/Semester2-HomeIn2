          I’m a basketball player, so I train regularly and stay active. I play games almost every Saturday or Sunday and practice throughout the week, here are some <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/MfLKwoXNzmR2ssZVA"target="_blank">videos</a> put together to show you this. My workouts include push-ups, planks, lunges, ab exercises, squats, wall sits, and sprints.
          For Health I do a couple things, I meditate before I go to bed. I also play binorial music to help me calm down.

      <h2>Social Studies</h2>

        <li>
          In Social Studies, I’ve completed a few packets on the Black Death and how it affected Europe and Asia in the 1300s . I also studied the Bill of Rights and memorized all 10 amendments. Right now, I’m learning about the separation of powers—the main functions of each branch, their limits, and how they work together. Here is <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/D2Ea7kxndZFxyL5U9"target="_blank">evidence</a>.

    <h2>Science</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I’ve taken part in programs at the <a href= "https://photos.app.goo.gl/ifw7vgTM8pNeXod99" target="_blank"> Rockville Science Center </a>. Most recently, I completed a class where we learned the basics of Java and created a working cash register project.
      </li>
      <li>
        I’ve also done science classes through <a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/RwY6CT3kHiHH2N329" target= "_blank"> Outschool</a>, an online platform that offers live classes on a wide variety of science topics. 
      </li>
      <li>
        At home, I did a fun <a href = "https://photos.app.goo.gl/JWPMHWKoC2yZAeFs8" target="_blank"> experiment </a> using an egg and vinegar to explore chemical reactions. We used the scientific method to make predictions, observe how the eggshell dissolved due to the acetic acid in vinegar, and explain the reaction between calcium carbonate and acid. We also beet juice as coloring in order to observe Osmosis.

          I’ve been attending classes at <a href="https://www.youthmediamd.org/" target="_blank">Action Youth Media (AYM)</a>, where I’m learning how to shoot and edit video. In the 
          <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/action-youth-media/schedules/activity-set/1376075?source=semesters" target="_blank">film production class</a>, we study how to plan and shoot films—from setting up shots to directing scenes. I also take a 
          <a href="https://www.hisawyer.com/action-youth-media/schedules/activity-set/1376076?source=semesters" target="_blank">video editing class</a>, where I learn how to cut and arrange footage, add effects, and tell stories using editing software. Outside of class, I edit videos for fun and recently created an Instagram page called 
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKBHzvWtysD/" target="_blank">marzz_editz</a> to share my work. If you click the link and then tap my username, you can view more of my edits. I try to post daily or at least every couple of days. I also enjoy drawing, especially anime characters like Naruto and ones from <em>Demon Slayer</em>. Drawing helps me relax, and I usually do it about once a month just for fun.

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Music is really calming for me. I used to play the violin and piano, but I lost interest because the music we were learning didn’t excite me. Now, I listen to artists like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, and Lil Baby. I’m not exactly sure what the difference is between hip-hop, rap, and drill—I just know I like the music. When I went to Jamaica, I listened to my Spotify playlist nonstop—at home, in the car, and even on the plane. Music helps me relax, decompress, and sometimes even get hyped and feel good.
