      <h2>Physical Education</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I’m a basketball player, so I have to work out and run regularly. I usually have games on Saturdays or Sundays and practice throughout the week. My workouts include push-ups, planks, lunges, ab exercises, squats, wall sits, and sprints.

      <h2>Social Studies</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In social studies, I’ve completed a few packets on the Black Death and how it affected Europe and Asia in the mid-1300s. I also learned about the Bill of Rights and memorized all ten amendments. Right now, I’m learning about the separation of powers—what each branch does, how much power it has, and how they work together.

        <li>
          I’ve been attending a class called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/actionyouthmedia/" target="_blank">AYM</a>, where we study how to shoot film. I also take a separate class there where we learn how to edit videos. In fact, I actually edit videos for fun. I recently started a page to showcase my edits called 
          <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DKBHzvWtysD/" target="_blank">"marzz_editz"</a>. If you click the link and then click the username, you can see more of my edits. I plan to post more videos—I try to post daily, or at least every two or three days. I also draw sometimes just to relax and have fun. I draw at least once a month, mostly anime characters like Naruto and Demon Slayer.

      <h2>Music</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Music is really calming for me. I used to have a violin and a piano, but I don’t play them anymore because I got bored of the songs we were learning. These days, I listen to artists like Kendrick Lamar, J. Cole, Lil Baby, and others. I don’t really know the difference between hip-hop, rap, and drill—I just enjoy the music I listen to. When I went to Jamaica, I listened to my Spotify playlist nonstop—in the house, during car rides, and even on the plane. Music helps me relax and decompress, or sometimes it hypes me up and puts me in a great mood.
